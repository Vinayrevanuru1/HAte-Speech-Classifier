# HAte-Speech-Classification

## Introduction

This Project aims to classify hate speech from a dataset taken from conversational AI


I performed four different classification techniques on the dataset and compared the results. The techniques used are:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Extreme Gradient Boosting
4. Extra Trees Classifier


## Steps to run the project

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. run the jupyter notebooks 
4. The results will be displayed in the notebook itself
